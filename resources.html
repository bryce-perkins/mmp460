                <h3>Effects of Industrial Farming on the Environment:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Over 37 percent of methane emissions result from factory farming. Methane has a global warming potential 20 times higher than carbon dioxide. </li>
                    <li>
                        factory farming releases harmful compounds like hydrogen sulfide and ammonia that can cause immediate negative health effects in humans
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Emissions and pollution resulting from all stages of agriculture, from production (pesticide drift and methane) to distribution (carbon dioxide) affect air quality and contribute to climate change.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Synthetic fertilizers deplete soil health and require intensive use of fossil fuels to produce.
                    </li>    
                </ul>
            </div>

                <h3>Animal Cruelty within Industrial Farming</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                cows Are forcefully impregnated every year in order to produce milk
                    </li>
                    <li>
                Chickens who get too sick or injured to enter the food supply are dumped into large mass graves alive
                    </li>
                    <li>
                chickens are not stunned, but shackled and dragged upside down, fully conscious, through electrified water that paralyzes their muscles so that their feathers will come off more easily after they are dead
                    </li>
                    <li>
                uncovered pigs shocked with electric prongs in their eyes, bludgeoned with metal pipes, kicked, and stabbed for minutes while still conscious.
                    </li>

                <h3>Effects of Industrial Farming on Workers and Farmers:</h3>
                <ul>
                <li>
                    Farmworkers and owners face a myriad of health risks, including chronic and acute exposure to pesticides, high risk of injury, and limited access to health care.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Routine antibiotic use in animal agriculture contributes to antibiotic resistance, diminishing the effectiveness of these drugs for human use.
                </li>
                <li>
                   Agricultural contaminants, including pesticides, nitrates, and phosphorus, impact ground and surface water quality, affecting both urban and rural communities.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Synthetic fertilizers deplete soil health and require intensive use of fossil fuels to produce.
                </li>

                    <li>
                        Scientists have shown that there is a link between exposure to the toxic chemicals found in animal waste and the development of neurological problems, including brain damage and depression.
